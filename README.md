Save your changes to update the record in CoreData.

**Deleting a User**

**CoreData Module**

Entity: User
Attributes:
name: String
email: String

User data is managed using a CoreData persistent container. When a user registers, their information is stored in the User entity. The app provides functionality to update and remove these entries, ensuring the data remains current.
